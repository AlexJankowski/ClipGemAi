# ClipGemAi

## About

I was annoyed that MS PowerToys doesn't allow gemini API so I created this python to handle this.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up ScreenAi locally:  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FurkanKhann/ScreenAi.git

2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
     ```bash
   pip install -r requirement.txt
3. Set up your API keys:
    ```bash
    GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_gemini_api_key"
    SELECTED_MODEL = "gemini-2.0-flash"  # Choose your desired model
